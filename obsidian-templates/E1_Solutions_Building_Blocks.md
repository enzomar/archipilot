# Solutions & Building Blocks

> Phase E — Mapping Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) to Solution Building Blocks (SBBs).

## Architecture Building Blocks → Solution Building Blocks

| ABB (Logical) | SBB (Physical) | Vendor / Product | Buy / Build | Status |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| | | | | |

## Build vs Buy Analysis

| Capability | Build | Buy | Recommendation | Rationale |

## Build vs Buy Legend
- **Build** — Develop in-house using internal engineering capacity
- **Buy** — License or subscribe to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product
- **Open Source** — Adopt and maintain an open-source solution
- **Partner** — Co-develop or white-label with a strategic partner

## Vendor Assessment
