# Business Architecture

## Business Capability Map

- **Customer Management** – CRM, onboarding, support
- **Order Fulfilment** – Inventory, logistics, delivery
- **Finance & Billing** – Invoicing, payments, reconciliation

## Value Streams

### Customer Onboarding
1. Lead capture → qualification → registration → activation
2. Average cycle: 3 business days
3. Bottleneck: manual identity verification

## Organisation Map

| Unit | Head | Capabilities |
|------|------|-------------|
| Engineering | CTO | Platform, DevOps, QA |
| Product | CPO | Roadmap, UX, Analytics |
| Operations | COO | Support, Fulfilment |

## Open Questions

### Capability Gaps
- Do we need a dedicated data-engineering capability?
