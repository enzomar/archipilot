# Example Vault

This is a minimal TOGAF-aligned architecture vault you can use to try archipilot.

## Quick Start

1. Open this workspace in VS Code with the archipilot extension active.
2. Open Copilot Chat (`Cmd+Shift+I`).
3. Type `@architect /status` to see the vault overview.
4. Try `@architect /decide Help me resolve AD-01` to get decision support.

## Creating Your Own Vault

Use `@architect /new My-Project-Name` to scaffold a full vault with all 28 TOGAF template files.
